"Eclipse of the Arcane"

    - Wizard student protagonist
    - Ancient darkness awakening
    - Artifacts / fragments of an Eclipse of the Arcane in each area
    - Spells typed by the user (correct = success, wrong = penalties)
    - Final choice: Save the world OR embrace dark magic
    - Two endings: Hero Ending / Dark Ending (Bad-but-still-win)

    Full Narrative Story Progression with Good & Bad Choice Paths

HP & Spell Choice Summary 

-Player HP: e.g., 10
-Boss HP: varies per boss

Spell effects:

-Good / learned properly → reduces boss HP safely, no corruption
-Dark / forbidden spell → reduces boss HP faster, increases corruption, minor backlash
-Mistyped / failed spell → minor self-damage, weak effect, no progress

Purpose:

-Player can always win, but using dark spells has future consequences
-Accumulated corruption affects dialogue, boss reactions, and final choice
-HP adds tactical limitation; reckless use can backfire

PROLOGUE — The Whisper in the Halls

Text:

Astravale Academy rises beneath silver towers, bathed in lantern light. Young mages practice their arts in quiet halls, but lately, strange things stir.

Whispers echo in the library at night.

Shadows stretch longer than their casters.

A cold wind carries a name you can almost hear:

“The Eclipse is waking…”

Your mentor, Professor Seraphine, summons you to her private study.

Dialogue cue:

Seraphine’s Warning (about Eclipse rising and the Grimoire fragments)

Mentor’s Instruction (quest: collect 3 fragments, be tested in skill & heart)

You leave her study, feeling the weight of your first great task.
